# # Baba-Ijebu Lotto
# 
# The main principle of the game is to choose the specific number from 1 to 90. There are different ways to play, and the amount of your win directly depends on how much you stake and how much winning numbers you have. There are five options: Permutations, 2 Sure, 3,4,5 Direct.
# 
# 
# **Baba Ijebu Permutation**
# 
# Choosing this way of winning you have a higher chance to win. It means that you can combine up to ten numbers and if at least two of them come out as a draw it means that you have won. As it is the easiest way to play, you should be ready that your win wonâ€™t be so high. It is more a way to return the money you have bet.
# 
# 
# **Baba Ijebu 2 Sure**
# 
# This way is the most popular, it also has less risk as the first option but promises the higher win. You are supposed to play two numbers out of 5 in a draw that will win. 
# 
# 
# **Baba Ijebu 3 Direct**
# 
# The principle is almost the same as with 2 Sure, but you win if out of 5 draw number you have 3. If you have two or one, sorry but you have lost. 
# 
# 
# **Baba Ijebu 4 Direct**
# 
# You will win if you have four numbers out of 5 draw. 
# 
# 
# **Baba Ijebu 5 Direct**
# 
# To win, you must predict five numbers out of 5 possible.
